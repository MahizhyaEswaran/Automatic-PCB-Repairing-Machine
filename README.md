# Automatic-PCB-Repairing-Machine
my CNC-based Automatic PCB Repairing Machine, built for my final year research at University of Peradeniya! ðŸš€ This 2-axis system uses a 3DOF SCARA robot with image processing for precise depth detection and a user-friendly interface. Demo 1 shows high accuracy and potential for future algorithm improvements.
